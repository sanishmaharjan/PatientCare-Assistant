## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-10

### üèóÔ∏è **Major Architectural Refactoring**

#### **Added**
- **Modular API Architecture**: Complete refactoring of monolithic 873-line API into clean, modular structure
- **New API Router System**: Separated medical operations and document management into dedicated routers
- **Comprehensive Request Logging**: Added detailed logging with timestamps, response times, and performance metrics
- **Interactive API Documentation**: Full Swagger UI at `/docs` with testing capabilities
- **CSS Externalization**: Moved all inline styles to dedicated `.css` files for better maintainability
- **Utility Functions**: Created `load_css_file()` helper for consistent CSS loading across components
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved error messages and debugging information throughout the system
- **Backup System Enhancement**: 3-backup retention with automatic cleanup of old backups

#### **Changed**
- **API Structure**: Moved from single-file API to modular router-based architecture:
  - `src/api/main.py` - Main FastAPI application
  - `src/api/routers/medical.py` - Medical endpoints (/medical/*)
  - `src/api/routers/documents.py` - Document management (/documents/*)
  - `src/api/models/schemas.py` - Pydantic data models
  - `src/api/middleware/logging.py` - Request monitoring
  - `src/api/utils/` - Shared utilities
  - `src/api/config/settings.py` - Configuration management

- **Frontend Navigation**: Renamed `pages/` directory to `page_modules/` to prevent Streamlit auto-navigation
- **CSS Organization**: Restructured styling system:
  - `src/frontend/styles/navigation.css` - Navigation component styles
  - `src/frontend/styles/questions.css` - Q&A component styles
  - `src/frontend/styles/components.css` - General component styles

- **Directory Structure**: Renamed `templates/` to `styles/` for better semantic clarity
- **Import Paths**: Updated all import statements to reflect new modular structure
- **API Endpoints**: Enhanced with better error handling and response models

#### **Fixed**
- **Critical API Startup Issue**: Fixed Python import path resolution in `src/api/app.py`
- **Control Script Functionality**: `./scripts/control.sh --start --api` now works correctly
- **Document Listing Bug**: Fixed string attribute error in file processing utilities
- **Navigation Conflicts**: Resolved Streamlit auto-navigation issues causing unwanted tabs
- **CSS Loading Issues**: Improved error handling for missing or invalid CSS files
- **Import Resolution**: Fixed circular import issues in modular architecture

#### **Performance Improvements**
- **Startup Time**: Reduced to ~1 second with optimized imports and dependency injection
- **Response Times**: Maintaining 1.4-1.9s average for medical queries
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized ChromaDB operations with automatic garbage collection
- **Hot Reloading**: Automatic server restart on code changes for better development experience

#### **Backward Compatibility**
- **Legacy Endpoints**: All original endpoints maintained and functional:
  - `POST /answer` ‚Üí redirects to `/medical/answer`
  - `POST /summary` ‚Üí redirects to `/medical/summary`
  - `POST /health-issues` ‚Üí redirects to `/medical/health-issues`
- **API Contracts**: No breaking changes to existing API contracts
- **Data Compatibility**: All existing data and configurations remain valid

#### **Documentation**
- **Updated README**: Comprehensive update reflecting new architecture and features
- **Enhanced Troubleshooting**: Added solutions for common issues and recent fixes
- **Architecture Documentation**: Complete overhaul of architecture diagrams and explanations
- **API Documentation**: Interactive docs with examples and testing capabilities

#### **Testing & Verification**
- **‚úÖ All API Endpoints**: Verified working correctly with comprehensive testing
- **‚úÖ Frontend Integration**: Streamlit successfully communicating with modular API
- **‚úÖ Document Processing**: File upload, processing, and retrieval all functional
- **‚úÖ Legacy Compatibility**: Backward compatibility confirmed for all endpoints
- **‚úÖ Control Scripts**: Server management scripts tested and working

### **Technical Metrics**
- **Code Organization**: Reduced from 1 monolithic file to 13+ modular components
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns with dependency injection
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error tracking and logging
- **Performance**: Optimized response times and memory usage
- **Documentation**: 100% API coverage with interactive testing
